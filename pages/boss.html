            <p id="narration">You come to and notice your hands and legs are bound. You hear a voice in the distance, “I shoulda just given you the address to my apartment!” Your eyes focus on a man with a glass eye standing a fair distance away from you. He’s grinning with an unlit cigar in his mouth. You shift your body so your hands can start to untie your feet. “But I’m a sporting guy and it looks like you are too“, he flips a lighter and ignites his cigar. You release the knot restraining your feet and shake your leg. Your switchblade creeps out of your pocket. He blows out a few puffs, “Plus I needed a sap to tie a double murder on. You may not know it but you’ve been digging your own grave.” Straining, you awkwardly pick up the knife with a hand that’s still bound. </p>
            <p id="instructions">This is the final showdown. When you’re ready click the button to start the timer. You’ll have a few seconds to take down the man with the glass eye. After the timer starts click on the image of the man with the glass eye to shoot him. One shot won’t be enough, but five hits should take him out. Good luck!</p>
